        <p>Follow these instructions to find out what hardware you're running.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click on your taskbar.</li>
            <li>Select Task Manager.</li>
            <li>Click on the "Performance" tab. If you don't see this, you might have to click "More details" at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Under the Performance tab, on the sidebar, click on the tab that says "CPU"</li>
            <li>On the top-right corner of the performance graph, you'll find the name of your CPU. (ex. AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D 8-Core Processor)</li>
            <li>Now click on the tab that says "GPU 0" (You might also have "GPU 1," more on that later). You'll find the name of your GPU in the top-right corner of the performance graph. (ex. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti)</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that this app was designed only for desktop PCs. If you're running a laptop, you'll probably be able to find your CPU here, but there are no mobile GPUs in the database, so you won't be able to get results for those.</p>
        <p>If you have multiple GPUs, it's probably because your PC has both a dedicated and integrated GPU. Integrated GPUs are in your processor, while dedicated GPUs are a standalone component. For this app, you want to find the dedicated one.  Try entering the names of both in the form. If one of them gets autocomplete results, that's the one you want.</p>
